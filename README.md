I'm Aamir, and I am a passionate information technology engineer from India. With several years of experience under my belt, I have honed my skills in front-end, back-end, and data-driven development. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, but what truly drives me is my insatiable desire to learn and grow. I am currently seeking new opportunities where I can continue to challenge myself and expand my knowledge.
